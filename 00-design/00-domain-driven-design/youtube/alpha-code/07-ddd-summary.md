# Domain Driven Design Summary

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFmPwhcS4wk

- Always design softwares in Top-Down fashion, unless your domain is trivial
- Focus on what distinguishes you from competitors and understand what you must excel at
- Always focus all your energy and resources in your core sub-domain
- Don't chase shiny objects by throwing technology at business problems
- Place emphasis on naming and operations

> Important tips

- Don't work for a company that thinks of software as a cost centre
- DDD will look just like OOP when you get the hang of it
- Don't create heavy weight blueprints before development, follow an evolutionary approach
- Write code and documentation so that it represents the domain
- Build a product for which you can provide long term warranties
