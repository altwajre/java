# DDD for Me

## Strategic Design

- Broad brushstrokes
- Segregate domain models using Bounded Contexts
- Develop a Ubiquitous Language as your domain model within an explicitly Bounded Context
- Subdomains
- Integrate multiple Bounded Contexts using a technique called Context Mapping
- Context Maps define both team relationships and technical mechanisms that exist between two integrating Bounded Contexts

## Tactical Design

- Thin brush to paint the fine details
- Aggregate pattern - aggregate entities and value objects together into a right-sized cluster
- Domain Events
- Interested parties might be your own local Bounded Context and other remote Bounded Context
