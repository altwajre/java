# Collaboration patterns vs design patterns

## Collaboration patterns are not design patterns.

`Design patterns` focus on efficiency, reuse, and pluggability, and while these are important goals, they are concerned more with `how` to effect an interaction, not `what` is involved in it.

`Collaboration patterns` describe the `what` of an interactionâ€”the objects involved and the rules governing those interactions.
