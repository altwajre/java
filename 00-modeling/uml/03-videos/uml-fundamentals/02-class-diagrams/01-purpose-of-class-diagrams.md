- Model the terms that are used in the business
- Model the collaborations between classes to implement use cases
- Model the structure of classes and interfaces in the system
- Reason about the system and how it will work
- Provide the basis for implementation in an object-oriented language

> Modeling Business Terms

- A class diagrams create a conceptual model of the topics in the business or problem domain
- Documents the relevant entities, their characteristics (attributes), their roles and relationships (associations) and constraints that govern the domain
- It helps to clarify the vocabulary of the business
- It communicates a shared understanding of the domain

> Modeling Class Collaborations

- A class diagram shows just those classes that collaborate to implement the functionality of a particular use case
- The class diagrams for all use cases can be assembled into a model for the full system
- Robustness analysis

> Reasoning About the System

- Analysis breaks the system down into elements, design synthesizes a solution from those elements
- There is rarely a single possible solution
- Class diagrams allow the designer to visualize different possible solutions and try them out without building the software
