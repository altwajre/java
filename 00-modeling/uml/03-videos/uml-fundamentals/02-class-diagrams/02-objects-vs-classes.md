> Objects and Classes

- Object-oriented languages
- Objects represent abstractions of instances of things of relevance to the domain
- Classes represent definitions of types of things in the system
- Object instances collaborate at run-time to deliver functionality

> Abstractions of things of Relevance

- Start with the things in the domain
- Cataloguing my books, I would identify the actual values associated with them
- I have a book called 'Hadoop: The Definitive Guide' By Tom White

> Classes as Definitions of Types

- Classes define the types
  - That the instances belong to and
  - That define the common properties of those instances

> Classes Organize Data and Code

- When we build o-o systems, classes define abstractions within the programming language

> Objects collaborate at Run Time

- Objects exist in memory, collaborating by interacting with one another to deliver the run-time functionality of the system
