- Inheritance in object-oriented systems
- Generalization/specialization notation
- Attributes and operations

> Inheritance in object-oriented systems

- A key aspect of object-oriented languages is the ability to define classes that inherit features from another class
- The inheriting classes are known as subclasses or child classes
- The class being inherited from is known as the superclass or parent class
- Each subclass is a specialization of the superclass
- The superclass is a generalization of the subclasses
- Subclasses inherit attributes, operations and relationships from the superclass
- Subclasses typically extend the superclass with additional attributes, operations and associations
- Subclasses may also override the definition of operations in the superclass

> Notation

- A generalization/specialization relationship is shown with an unfilled triangle at the superclass end of the relationship

> Inheritance

- A subclass inherits attributes and operations and operations, which can be shown with the name of the superclass
- A subclass can extend the superclass by adding attributes or operations
- A subclass can redefine superclass operations
