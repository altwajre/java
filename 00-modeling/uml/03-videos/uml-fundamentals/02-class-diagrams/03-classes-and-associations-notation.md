> Notation of classes

- Classes represent the categories of people, things, events
- Simplest notation - a rectangle with the name of the class at the top
- Class name - initial capital letter
- Join words together using Pascal case, for example 'BookEdition'

> Compartments in classes

- In a diagram, classes may show a number of compartments
- Usually there are at least two: for attributes and operations

> Notation of Associations $$$

- Associations - relationships between classes in the model that reflect relationships in the real world
- Simplest notation - a solid line between two classes $$$
- Association name - read as for example 'An Author writes a Book'
