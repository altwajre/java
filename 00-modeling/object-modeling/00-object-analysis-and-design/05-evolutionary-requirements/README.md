In the UP, requirements are categorized according to the FURPS+ model [Grady92], a useful mnemonic with the following meaning:[1]

- Functional: features, capabilities, security.
- Usability: human factors, help, documentation.
- Reliability: frequency of failure, recoverability, predictability.
- Performance: response times, throughput, accuracy, availability, resource usage.
- Supportability: adaptability, maintainability, internationalization, configurability.

The “+” in FURPS+ indicates ancillary and sub-factors, such as:

- Implementation: resource limitations, languages and tools, hardware, ...
- Interface: constraints imposed by interfacing with external systems.
- Operations: system management in its operational setting.
- Packaging: for example, a physical box.
- Legal: licensing and so forth.
