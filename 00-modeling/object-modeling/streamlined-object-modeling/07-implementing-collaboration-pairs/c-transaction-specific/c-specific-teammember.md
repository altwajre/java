# Team Member

The TeamMember class needs the following definition updates to collaborate with nomination objects:
- Add a variable to the TeamMember class for holding the collection of nominations.
- Add to the team member profile interface a collaboration accessor for the team member's nominations.
- Add to the team member conduct business interface collaboration accessors to add and remove a nomination
- Add to the team member conduct business interface collaboration accessors to add and remove a nomination.

We will also update the constructor or initialize methods to create a collection object for the nominations when a team member is created.

Accessors must be added to get all nominations, add a single nomination, and remove a particular nomination.

Because TeamMember is not the coordinator, no changes are needed to allow for printing, comparing or testing.
