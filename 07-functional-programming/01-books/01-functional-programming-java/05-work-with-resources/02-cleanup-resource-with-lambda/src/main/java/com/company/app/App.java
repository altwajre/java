note:
When a team had to perform operations within the bounds of transactions. Rather than creating and managing transactions
all over the code, we wrapped them into a nice runWithinTransaction method. The methodâ€™s callers received a transaction
instance, and when they returned the method took care of checking the status as well as performing actions such as
committing or rolling back the transaction and logging.
