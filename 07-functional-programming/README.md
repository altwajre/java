# functional programming

# guidelines
- be declarative
- promote immutability
- avoid side effects (avoid assignments - assign value to variable)
- prefer expressions over statements
- design with higher-order functions
  * pass functions to functions
  * create functions within functions
  * return functions from functions

## functional interfaces
- Runnable
- Callable
- Comparable
- Predicate
- Consumer

### When functional interface as a parameter, then pass the following:
- an anonymous inner class, the old-fashioned way (but why would we?)
- a lambda expression, like we did when we called the map method
- a method or constructor reference
