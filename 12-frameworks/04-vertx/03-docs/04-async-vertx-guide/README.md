1. Design a web application with server-side rendering of pages through templates, and using a relational database for
persisting data.
2. Cleanly isolate each technical components as a reusable event processing unit called a verticle.
3. Extract Vert.x services for facilitating the design of verticles that communicate with each other seamlessly both
within the same JVM process or among distributed nodes in a cluster.
4. Testing code with asynchronus operations.
5. Integrating with third-party services exposing a HTTP/JSON web API.
6. Exposing a HTTP/JSON web API.
7. Securing and controlling access using HTTPS, user authentication for web browser sessions and JWT tokens for 
third-party client applications.
8. Refactoring some code to use reactive programming with the popular RxJava library and its Vert.x integration.
9. Client-side programming of a single-page application with AngularJS.
10. Real-time web programming using the unified Vert.x event bus integration over SockJS.
