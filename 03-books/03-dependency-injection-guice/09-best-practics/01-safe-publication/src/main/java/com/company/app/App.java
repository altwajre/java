This is another manifestation of the visibility problems. There are several reasons why Thread B may see a null value,
even though as far as Thread A is concerned, the map has been updated. We encountered one of these in an earlier chapter
when looking at memory coherency. Without sufficient synchronization, the JVM makes no guarantees about visibility of
fields between threads. This is a deliberate choice made by the language designers to allow for maximum flexibility in
optimizations on various platforms. Thread A's updates to the hashtable may not yet be synchronized with main memory.
Thus, they're not published to other threads. So while a thread can see its own updates, there's no assurance that
others will. Now let's look at how to correctly publish to all threads.

MoreUnsafePublication is a simple variant of the hashtable that reads an email address using its dependency EmailDatabase.
This time the issue of publication is not with the hashtable values but with the EmailDatabase dependency itself. Threads
that call method read() cannot rely on the fact that the dependency is available. Without sufficient synchronization,
the thread creating the object does not safely publish its fields to other threads.
The MoreUnsafePublication.read() could easily result in a NullPointerException.
