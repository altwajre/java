# Document all exceptions thrown by each method

## JavaDoc

```
Use the Javadoc @throws tag to document each unchecked exception that a method can throw, but do not use the throws 
keyword to include unchecked exceptions in the method declaration. It is important that the programmers using your API 
be aware of which exceptions are checked and which are unchecked, as their responsibilities differ in these two cases. 
The documentation generated by the Javadoc @throws tag in the absence of the method header gener- ated by the throws 
declaration provides a strong visual cue to help the program- mer distinguish checked exceptions from unchecked.
