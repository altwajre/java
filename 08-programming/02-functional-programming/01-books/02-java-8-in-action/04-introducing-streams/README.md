# getting started with streams

```
Streams are an update to the Java API that lets you manipulate collections of data in a declarative way.
Stream is sequence of elements from a source that supports data processing operations.
 Sequence of elements - Like a collection, a stream provides an interface to a sequenced set of values of specific element type.
 Source - Streams consume from a data-providing source such as collections, arrays, or I/O resources.
 Data processing operations - Streams support database-like operations and common operations from functional programming
  languages to manipulate data, such as filter, map, reduce, find, match, sort, and so on.
