- Methods are defined using def
- Methods are not functions

- Last evaluated statement will be returned
- Most of the time you can omit the return type

## Reasons to include return types

- Make intentions clear
- Type inferencer inferred the wrong type
- Your method will be called recursively
- Your method is overloaded
