# Infix Operators

- Infix operators allow a method to be invoked without the dot or parenthesis
- Infix operators will work if the method has one parameter
- It can somewhat work with more than one parameter, but the parameters would have to be inside parenthesis
- Mathematical operations in Scala use infix operators
