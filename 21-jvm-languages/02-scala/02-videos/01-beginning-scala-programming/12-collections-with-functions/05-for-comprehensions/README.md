# For Comprehensions

- For comprehensions are just map, flatMap, withFilter, and foreach behind the scenes.
- They look like for loops, but are not, for one they can be assigned to a value.
- They return collections like Lists, Sets, Options, etc.
- Any object with map, floatMap, withFilter, and foreach can be used in a for comprehension
