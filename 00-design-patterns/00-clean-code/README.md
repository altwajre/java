Creational patterns create instances of object
Structural patterns set-up the communications pathways between separate groups of objects
Behavioral patterns partition the behaviors of the system into discrete classes

Every pattern pursues the goal: dependency management.
Patterns geared at figuring out how to separate the elements of the system.

Command is an interface named Command with a single method named execute. It is like a function.
Remember that all objects are composed of functions. It's just that sometimes functions need to be decomposed.

Command pattern is a way of decoupling what is done from who does it.
Decoupling actors from actions seems likely to enhance flexibility.
