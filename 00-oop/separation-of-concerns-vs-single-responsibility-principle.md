- Separation of Concerns
Works at both high and low levels

- Single Responsibility Principle
Works on basic units - works at a low level

- SRP and SoC are the same at the low level

## Separation of concerns

- Separation of concerns (SoC). Divide your application into distinct features with as little overlap in functionality as possible.

- Separation of concerns (SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern.

- "Concern" = "distinct feature" = "distinct section"

> Concern

- In computer science, a concern is a particular set of information that has an effect on the code of a computer program. A concern can be as general as the details of database interaction or as specific as performing a primitive calculation, depending on the level of conversation between developers and the program being discussed.
- "Concern" is at both high level and low level
- "Concern" is a component, module, class, function

## Single Responsibility Principle

- Single Responsibility Principle states that every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class. All its services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.

- A class should have only one reason to change

- "Responsibility" = "reason to change"
"change what?" - a single part of the functionality provided by the software = Basic Unit
