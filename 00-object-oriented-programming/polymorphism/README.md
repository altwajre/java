# Polymorphism

- Polymorphism is when an Object can take many forms
- In OOP Polymorphism occurs when a reference that has the type of a parent Class is used to an Object of a child Class
- Any Java Object that passes more than one Is-A test is polymorphic
- All Java Objects are polymorphic since any of them will pass the IS-A test for their own type and for the Class Object
- A reference variable can only be of the declared type
- Unless declared final a reference can be reassigned to other Objects
- A reference variable can refer to any other Object of the same declared type or any subtype of the declared type
- A reference's variable type determines the method that can be invoked on the referenced Object
- A reference variable can be declared as a Class type or an Interface type
