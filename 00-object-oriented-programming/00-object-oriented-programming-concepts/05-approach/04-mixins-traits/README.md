Default methods

> Maintenance Problem

If a developer adds a method declaration to an existing interface then all Class that already implement that interface
must implement the newly added method

> Default Methods

Java 8 introduces default methods to allows developers to add new methods to an Interface without breaking the existing
implementations.
