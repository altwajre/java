# Singleton Objects

- Objects are singletons
- Objects are Scala's replacement for the keyword static
- Objects are meant for factories, defining pattern matching, defining defaults, and main methods
- Main methods are always inside of objects
- You can forget the main declaration by having your object extend App

## Classes

- Need to define a template to create multiple instances
- Every instance is in charge of it's own state

## Objects

- Need a singleton
- Need a factory pattern
- Need to implement pattern matching logic
- Need a utility method that doesn't require an instance or state
- Need default values
