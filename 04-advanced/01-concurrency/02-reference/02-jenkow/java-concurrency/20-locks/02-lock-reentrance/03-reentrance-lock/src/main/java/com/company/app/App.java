Problem:
A thread calling outer() will first lock the Lock instance. Then it will call inner(). Inside the inner() method the
thread will again try to lock the Lock instance. This will fail (meaning the thread will be blocked), since the Lock
instance was locked already in the outer() method.

The reason the thread will be blocked the second time it calls lock() without calling unlock() in between, is apparent
when we look at the lock() implementation.

It is the condition inside the while loop (spin lock) that determines if a thread is allowed to exit the lock() method or
not. Currently the condition is that isLocked must be false for this to be allowed, regardless of what thread locked it.

Solution:
Notice how the while loop (spin lock) now also takes the thread that locked the Lock instance into consideration.
If either the lock is unlocked (isLocked=false) or the calling thread is the thread the locked the Lock instance,
the while loop will not execute, and the thread calling lock() will be allowed to exit the method.

Additionally, we need to count the number of times the lock has been locked by the same thread. Otherwise,
a single call to unlock() will unlock the lock, even if the lock has been locked multiple times.
We donâ€™t want the lock to be unlocked until the thread that locked it, has executed the same amount
of unlock() calls as lock() calls.
