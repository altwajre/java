A BlockingQueue is typically used to have on thread produce objects, which another thread consumes.
Here is a diagram that illustrates this principle:

The producing thread will keep producing new objects and insert them into the queue, until the queue reaches
some upper bound on what it can contain. Itâ€™s limit, in order words. If the blocking queue reaches its upper limit,
the producing thread is blocked while trying to insert the new object. It remains blocked until a consuming thread
takes an object out of the queue.

The consuming thread keeps taking objects out of the blocking queue, and processes them. If the consuming thread
tries to take an object out of an empty queue, the consuming thread is blocked until a producing thread puts
an object into the queue.
