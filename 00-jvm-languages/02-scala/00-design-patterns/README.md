## Qualities Of Design Patterns

Design pattern qualities include
- Capturing knowledge and promoting design reuse
- Serving as a vehicle of communication
Patterns serve as a vehicle of communication in the sense that they enable a
common vocabulary for different stakeholders involved in a given software project.
- Documenting software architecture
Design patterns also come in handy when documenting software architecture. Given
an overview of which and how different pattern applied to the architecture,
enables newcomers to the project to understand the overall architecture.
