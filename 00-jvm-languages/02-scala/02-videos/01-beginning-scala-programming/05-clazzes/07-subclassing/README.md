# Subclassing

- extends is a keyword used to subclass a class from another class
- Attributes belonging to super class are sent to the superclass's constructor
- Inheritance must have a "is-a" relationship
- All subclasses are polymorphic, by assignment or method call
- You can have multiple classes in one file
