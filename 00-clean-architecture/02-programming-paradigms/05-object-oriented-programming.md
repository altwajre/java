# Object-Oriented Programming

OO is the ability through the use of polymorphism, to gain absolute control over every source code dependency in the system.

## ENCAPSULATION

OO languages have little or no enforced encapsulation.

## INHERITANCE

We can award no point to OO for encapsulation, and perhaps a half-point for inheritance.

## POLYMORPHISM

OO language makes polymorphism trivial.
That fact provides an enormous power that old C programmers could only dream of.

### The Power Of Polymorphism

OO allows the plugin architecture to be used anywhere, for anything.

## Dependency Inversion

OO languages provide safe and convenient polymorphism means that any source code dependency, no matter where it is, can be inverted.

UI and database can be plugins to the business rules.
