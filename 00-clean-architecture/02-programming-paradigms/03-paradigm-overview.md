## Structure Programming

Use structured programming as the algorithmic foundation of our modules.

Structured programming imposes discipline on direct transfer of control.

It replaces the jumps (goto) with the more familiar if/then/else and do/while/until constructs.

## Object Oriented Programming

Use polymorphism as the mechanism to cross architectural boundaries.

Object-oriented programming imposes discipline on indirect transfer of control.

Polymorphism through the disciplined use of function pointers

## Functional Programming

Use functional programming to impose discipline on the location of access data.

Functional programming imposes discipline upon assignment.

It has no assignment statement.
