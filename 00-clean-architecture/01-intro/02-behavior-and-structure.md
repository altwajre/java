# Behavior and Structure

Eisenhower matrix

Behavior (feature) is urgent
Architecture is important

1. Urgent and important
2. Not urgent and important
3. Urgent and not important
4. Not urgent and not important

The mistake that business managers and developers often make is to elevate items in position 3 to position 1.
They fail to separate those failures that are urgent but not important from those features that truly are urgent and important.
This failures then leads to ignoring the important architecture of the system in favor of the unimportant features of the system.

It is the software development team responsibility to assert the importance of architecture over the urgency of features.

## FIGHT FOR THE ARCHITECTURE

The development team has to struggle for what they believe to be best for the company, and so do the management team, and the marketing team, and the sales team, and the operations team.
They make a noise with all the other stakeholders as equals because a software developer is a stakeholder.
You have a stake in the software that you need to safeguard.
That's part of your role, and part of your duty.
