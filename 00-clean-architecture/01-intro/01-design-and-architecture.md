## The Goal

The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system.

The measure of design quality is simply the measure of the effort required to meet the needs of the customer.
If that effort is low, and stays low throughout the lifetime of the system, the design is good.
If that effort grows with each new release, the design is bad.
