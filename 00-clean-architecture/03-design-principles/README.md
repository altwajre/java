SOLID principles arrange the bricks into walls and rooms.

## SRP: The Single Responsibility Principle

Each software module has one, and only one reason to change.

## OCP: The Open-Closed Principle

Software systems should be easy to change, they must be designed to allow the behavior of those systems to be changed by adding new code, rather than changing existing code.

## LSP: The Liskov Substitution Principle

Build software systems from interchangeable parts, those parts must adhere to a contract that allows those parts to be substituted one for another.

## ISP: The Interface Segregation Principle

Avoid depending on things that they don't use.

## The Dependency Inversion Principle

The code that implements high-level policy should not depend on the code that implements low-level details.
Details should depend on policies.
