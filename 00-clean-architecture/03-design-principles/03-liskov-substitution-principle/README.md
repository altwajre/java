# Liskov's Substitution Principle(LSP)

The LSP should be extended to the level of architecture.
A simple violation of substitutability can cause a system's architecture to be polluted.

Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types.
Must make sure that the new derived classes just extend without replacing the functionality of existing classes.
