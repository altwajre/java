# What Is Architecture

The primary purpose of architecture is to support the life cycle of the system. Good architecture makes the system easy to understand, easy to develop, easy to maintain, and easy to deploy.
The ultimate goal is to minimize the lifetime cost of the system and to maximize programmer productivity.

## Development

A software system that is hard to develop is not likely to have a healthy lifetime.
The architecture of a system should make that system easy to develop.

## Deployment

A software system must be deployable to be effective.
Make a system that can be easily deployed with a single action.

## Operation

A good software architecture communicates the operational needs of the system.

## Maintenance

Of all the aspects of a software system, maintenance is the most costly.
By separating the system into components, and isolating those components through stable interfaces for future features and greatly reduce the risk of inadvertent breakage.

## Keeping Options Open

The software has two types of value: behavior and structure that is greater because it makes software soft.
The way to keep software soft is to leave as many options open as possible.
