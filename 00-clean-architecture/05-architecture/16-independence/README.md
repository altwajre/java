- The use case and operation of the system
- The maintenance of the system
- The development of the system
- The deployment of the system

## Use Cases

Use cases means that the architecture of the system must support the intent of the system.

## Operation

Architecture must support the operation of the system. If the system must handle 100,000 customers per second, the architecture must support that kind of throughput and response time for each use case.

## Development

Architecture must support the development environment.
A system that must be developed by an organization with many teams and many concerns must have an architecture that facilitates independent actions by those teams, so that the teams do not interfere with each other during development.

## Deployment
