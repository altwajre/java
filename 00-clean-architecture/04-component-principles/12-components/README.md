Components are the units of deployment.
They are the smallest entities that can be deployed as part of a system.
In Java, they are jar files.
Components can be linked together into a single executable.
Components always retain the ability to be independently deployable and independently developable.

The dynamically linked files, which can be plugged together at runtime are the software Components of architectures.
