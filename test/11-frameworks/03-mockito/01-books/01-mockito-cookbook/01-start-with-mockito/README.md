> Dummy

This is an object that is used only for the code to compile - it doesn't have any business logic

> Fake

This is an object that has an implementation, but it's not production ready

> Stub

This is an object that has predefined answers to method executions made during the test

> Mock

This is an object that has predefined answers to method executions made during the test and has recorded expectations of these executions

> Spy

These are objects that are similar to stubs, but they additionally record how they were executed
