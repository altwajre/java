# spy

A spy secretly obtains the information of a rival or someone very important. A spy object spies on a real object. A spy
is a variation of a stub, but instead of only setting the expectation, a spy records the method calls made to the
collaborator. A spy can act as an indirect output of the unit under test and can also act as an audit log.
