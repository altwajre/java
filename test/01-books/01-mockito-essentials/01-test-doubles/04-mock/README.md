# mock

A mock object is a combination of a spy and a stub. It acts as an indirect output for a code under test, such as a spy,
and also stub methods to return values or throw exceptions, like a stub. A mock object fails a test if an expected method
is not invoked or if the parameters of the method donâ€™t match.
