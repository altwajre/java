## Virtual User

- DSL (Domain Specific Language) - fast writing of scenarios and easy maintenance of existing scenarios
- Ability to deal with logic between requests
- Gatling implements virtual users as messages instead of threads which scales much better

## Simulation

A simulation is a description of the load test. It describes how, possibly several, user populations will run: which scenario they will execute and how new virtual users will be injected.
