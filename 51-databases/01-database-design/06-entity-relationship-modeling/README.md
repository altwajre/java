`EER Model` the enhanced entity-relationship model is a high-level or conceptual data model incorporating extensions to the original entity-relationship (ER) model, 
            used in the design of databases.
`ERD` an entity relationship diagram shows the relationships of entity sets stored in a database.
`ER Model` the entity-relationship model is a way of graphically representing the logical relationships of entities (or objects) in order to create database.
`DDL` data definition language - create table and columns.

`Cardinality` is the maximum number of connections a row of one table can have with row(s) of another table. 
              This is basically just a fancy word to describe the two options: 1 or many.
              For many-to-many relationship, the cardinality would be best designed as two separate one-to-many relationships with the intermediary table in the middle.

`Modality` two possibilities are 0 or 1. 1 is the equivalent as making the foreign key column as NOT NULL.
