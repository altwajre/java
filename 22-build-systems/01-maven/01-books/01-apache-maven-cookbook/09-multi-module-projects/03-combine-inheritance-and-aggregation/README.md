# Combining inheritance and aggregation

> `project inheritance` - build at `child`

By using the project inheritance, we can share common build attributes such as properties and dependencies across all children.

The parent is not aware of the child.

> `project aggregation` - build at `parent`

We can also aggregate modules and build them together.

Each module is not aware of the aggregation.
