# Building a JAR project

The default type of artifact generated by Maven is JAR.
A JAR project combines all the source classes along with the necessary project resources to a single file.
This JAR file can be distributed for it to be used elsewhere.

> `pom` file

```
  <groupId>com.company.app</groupId>
  <artifactId>jar-project</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <packaging>jar</packaging>
```
