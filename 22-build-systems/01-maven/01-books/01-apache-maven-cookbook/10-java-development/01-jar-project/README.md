# Building a JAR project

The default type of artifact generated by Maven is JAR.
A JAR project combines all the source classes along with the necessary project resources to a single file.
This JAR file can be distributed for it to be used elsewhere.

The JAR artifact generated by Maven works well when used as a dependency in another project.
But, it cannot be run as an executable without manually specifying the main class and explicitly specify dependencies that the project uses in the classpath.
