A common mistake some people could make is try and put everything into a facade. 
This is something that usually doesn't help and the developers remain with a complex system, if not more, as before. 
Facade could prove to be restrictive for those users who have enough domain knowledge to use the original functionality. 
This is especially true if facade is the only way to interact with the underlying system.
