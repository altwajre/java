> What it is not so good for

Whenever the frameworks we implement using the template method design pattern become large, 
it is harder to simply extend a huge class and implement a few of its methods. 
In cases like these, passing an interface to the constructor 
and using it in the skeleton might be a better idea (strategy design pattern).
