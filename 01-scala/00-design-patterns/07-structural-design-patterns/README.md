# Summary

- Adapter versus Bridge: Adapter is used to convert one interface to another when we do not have access to the code. 
Bridge is used while designing software and it decouples abstraction from implementation for easier extensions in the future.

- Proxy versus Decorator: Decorators usually enhance an interface. 
Proxies provide the same interface, but help with application efficiency.
