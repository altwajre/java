As we saw in our type-safe builder example, adding more advanced logic and requirements could involve quite a bit of work. 
Without this possibility, the developer will risk the users of their classes making more mistakes. 
Also, the builder contains quite a lot of seemingly duplicate code, especially when it is implemented using a Java-like code.
